The Persona Economy: Transforming Domains into Living AI Assets
Powered by Doma Protocol | Version 1.0 | October 2025
 
üìã Executive Summary
RivalismeUniverse represents the first comprehensive platform that transforms internet domains from static addresses into dynamic, intelligent AI personalities capable of generating content, competing for market value, and creating sustainable revenue streams for their creators.
Built in partnership with Doma Protocol, we're establishing the foundational infrastructure for the Persona Economy - a new economic paradigm where human knowledge and expertise achieve digital immortality through competing AI personas that generate value 24/7.
Key Innovation: Multiple users can create different versions of the same historical figure (Einstein #001, Einstein #047, etc.), each with unique training and capabilities, competing in community-driven arenas for market dominance and user preference.
 
üåê The Market Opportunity
Three Converging Markets
1. Domain Industry ($20B+ annually)
‚Ä¢	370+ million registered domains worldwide
‚Ä¢	97% of domains generate zero utility beyond basic redirects
‚Ä¢	Domain parking generates minimal passive income
‚Ä¢	Our Solution: Transform domains into revenue-generating AI personalities
2. AI Services Market ($150B+ projected by 2025)
‚Ä¢	Generic AI solutions lack personalization and ownership
‚Ä¢	No mechanism for users to own or monetize AI interactions
‚Ä¢	Limited educational and creative applications
‚Ä¢	Our Solution: Personalized, ownable, competitive AI personas
3. Education Technology ($400B+ globally)
‚Ä¢	Traditional learning methods lack engagement
‚Ä¢	Limited access to expert knowledge and mentorship
‚Ä¢	No gamification or competitive learning elements
‚Ä¢	Our Solution: Interactive learning with historical figures and competitive knowledge acquisition
Total Addressable Market: $1.15 Trillion+
Including content creation ($100B+), professional services ($200B+), brand marketing ($150B+), and enterprise software ($300B+).
